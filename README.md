Birthday Responder
==================
For the lazy ones. for those of us who feel a need to thank every birthday post but at the same time feel too lazy to actually do that. No need to put up a single status to thank everyone, use the script to thank everyone individually.

the whole idea of computing is - the machine should work more than the man.

Usage
-----
```python
>> python Responder.py profile_id access_token last_post_id
```
